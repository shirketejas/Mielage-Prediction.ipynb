The objective of a Mileage Prediction Regression Analysis project encompasses several goals aimed at enhancing vehicle efficiency, consumer information, and environmental sustainability. Primarily, it seeks to develop accurate models for predicting vehicle mileage based on factors like engine size, weight,displacement,horsepower,weight,accleration etc which can aid in fuel consumption forecasting. Understanding influential factors such as environmental conditions and vehicle design is crucial for optimizing vehicle designs and promoting eco-friendly innovations. This project also aims to provide valuable guidance to consumers and fleet managers, helping them make informed decisions regarding vehicle purchases, cost-efficiency, and maintenance.
